## Project Description
The purpose of this project was to create a machine learning model 
that can use different information about network traffic to try and predict what port the traffic is coming from.

## Data Source
The data for this model can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/542/internet+firewall+data).

## Pre-processing

## Data Understanding


## Algorithms
### Support Vector Machines

### Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE)
Another algorithm that was used for this model was SMOTE. 
SMOTE is a method used in machine learning to help address imbalanced datasets by generating new data.
It does this by picking a minority class sample, finding its nearest neighbors, 
and generating new points along the line between them.
